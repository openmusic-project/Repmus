Inputs :

coll : A chordseq, a list of chords, a list of list of midics.
pred : (optional) a predicate (e.g. a subpatch in lambda mode) with 2 arguments or the output of a 'mk-pred' box.

If pred is given, it defines an alternate relation to examine between chords.
pred must be ready to compare 2 numbers (e.g. midic) and answer T or Nil.
By default, pred is the equality predicate.
Example : pred = (lambda (x y) (= (abs (- x y)) 100))
will quantify the chromatic-step relation instead of common-notes.

Output :

solutions as there are nodes (i.e. chords) in the graph.

parameters

graph : the output of a 'make-graph' box
solu : positive integer. Choose a solution between 0 and n-1 (n is the number of chords)
link : (optional, menu) if 'with link' adds a low common note when there is no common notes between 2 chords.
order : (optional, menu) if 'maximize' look for path that maximizes the relations (default). If 'minimize' look for path of maximum contrast.
trav : (optional, menu) if 'short' (default) short path without repetitions. If 'long' long path with repetitions.
stat : (optional, menu) if 'one solution' (default) output the solu(nth) solution. If 'statistics' print all the solutions with an 
optimality factor.

output

Depends on the kind objects that have been put into the graph (see 'make-graph') : 
If the graph was built with a list of lists  of integers, output is a list of lists of integers.
If the graph was built with a list of chord-objects or a chord-line object, output is list of chord objects.
The output is generally connected to the 'chords' input of a 'chordseq' box.
